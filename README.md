# Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Computer Vision

This repository is dedicated to learning the basics of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks and implementing various computer vision algorithms using this framework. The goal is to explore the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these networks in the field of computer vision.

## Table of Contents

- TBD

## To-Do List

- [x] Implement basic Kolmogorov-Arnold network from scratch
- [x] Apply the network to basic image classification tasks
- [ ] Optimize for CUDA (at least try whats the deal with it)
- [ ] try other basis functions
- [ ] unsupervised, ssl
